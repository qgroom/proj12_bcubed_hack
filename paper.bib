    abstract = {In contrast to theoretical predictions of even adult sex ratios, males are dominating in many bird populations. Such bias among adults may be critical to population growth and viability. Nevertheless, demographic mechanisms for biased adult sex ratios are still poorly understood. Here, we examined potential demographic mechanisms for the recent dramatic shift from a slight female bias among adult eider ducks (Somateria mollissima) to a male bias (about 65% males) in the Baltic Sea, where the species is currently declining. We analysed a nine-year dataset on offspring sex ratio at hatching based on molecularly sexed ducklings of individually known mothers. Moreover, using demographic data from long-term individual-based capture-recapture records, we investigated how sex-specific survival at different ages after fledgling can modify the adult sex ratio. More specifically, we constructed a stochastic two-sex matrix population model and simulated scenarios of different survival probabilities for males and females. We found that sex ratio at hatching was slightly female-biased (52.8%) and therefore unlikely to explain the observed male bias among adult birds. Our stochastic simulations with higher survival for males than for females revealed that despite a slight female bias at hatching, study populations shifted to a male-biased adult sex ratio (> 60% males) in a few decades. This shift was driven by prime reproductive-age individuals (≥5-year-old), with sex-specific survival of younger age classes playing a minor role. Hence, different age classes contributed disproportionally to population dynamics. We argue that an alternative explanation for the observed male dominance among adults–sex-biased dispersal–can be considered redundant and is unlikely, given the ecology of the species. The present study highlights the importance of considering population structure and age-specific vital rates when assessing population dynamics and management targets.},

	abstract = {A preliminary survey of the sex ratios of Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Wigeon A. penelope, Pochard Aythya ferina and Tufted Duck A. fuligula by field counts was made in the winter of 1983-4.  Data were collected from 184 sites with a good geographical spread in Britain.  There was no significant variation in the sex ratio for any species in any month from December to March.  Only Pochard showed significant trend with latitude, but the effect was substantial.  South of 51N there were 150 male Pochard per 100 females, compared with 840 north of 58N.  There were significant variations among habitat types and size of flocks, and in both cases the variation was consistent with the hypothesis that there is competition between the sexes for favoured sites.  The sex ratio in the shooting bag, as shown by national wing surveys, was similar to that in the field, so that there is no significant differential vulnerability between males and females.  Data from the remainder of the wintering range indicate that the populations of each of the four species has a surplus of males.  The estimates were 120-150 males per 100 females for Mallard, 132M/100F for Wigeon, 150-250M/100F for Pochard and in excess of 130M/100F for Tufted Duck.  We support the hypothesis that inter-sexual competition rather than cold stress is the main factor leading to differential migration of the sexes.  Females travel further and probably suffer greater mortality as a result.  Inter-sexual competition is probably also responsible for increasing female mortality directly, through starvation caused by exclusion from wintering habitat.},
