    abstract = {In contrast to theoretical predictions of even adult sex ratios, males are dominating in many bird populations. Such bias among adults may be critical to population growth and viability. Nevertheless, demographic mechanisms for biased adult sex ratios are still poorly understood. Here, we examined potential demographic mechanisms for the recent dramatic shift from a slight female bias among adult eider ducks (Somateria mollissima) to a male bias (about 65% males) in the Baltic Sea, where the species is currently declining. We analysed a nine-year dataset on offspring sex ratio at hatching based on molecularly sexed ducklings of individually known mothers. Moreover, using demographic data from long-term individual-based capture-recapture records, we investigated how sex-specific survival at different ages after fledgling can modify the adult sex ratio. More specifically, we constructed a stochastic two-sex matrix population model and simulated scenarios of different survival probabilities for males and females. We found that sex ratio at hatching was slightly female-biased (52.8%) and therefore unlikely to explain the observed male bias among adult birds. Our stochastic simulations with higher survival for males than for females revealed that despite a slight female bias at hatching, study populations shifted to a male-biased adult sex ratio (> 60% males) in a few decades. This shift was driven by prime reproductive-age individuals (≥5-year-old), with sex-specific survival of younger age classes playing a minor role. Hence, different age classes contributed disproportionally to population dynamics. We argue that an alternative explanation for the observed male dominance among adults–sex-biased dispersal–can be considered redundant and is unlikely, given the ecology of the species. The present study highlights the importance of considering population structure and age-specific vital rates when assessing population dynamics and management targets.},

	abstract = {Abstract Opportunistic citizen science produces large amounts of primary biodiversity data but is underutilized in the conservation and management of protected areas despite these areas’ status as citizen science hotspots. Application of these data may be limited by the challenge of understanding sampling patterns associated with opportunistic data at a scale relevant to local area management. An improved understanding of citizen science activity patterns within protected areas could strengthen both data analysis and the local promotion and guidance of citizen science activity. We investigated local-scale patterns of citizen science activity, using a case study approach to examine citizen science activity in a recreationally popular natural area that serves as a regional citizen science hotspot. We modelled the relationship between local citizen science activity and 10 spatial covariates broadly related to ease of access and natural interest, factors which have been shown to drive citizen science activity at regional scales. We further compared the distribution of citizen science activity with that of professional data collection and recreational visitor activity in the study area. We found that citizen science data largely complement rather than replicate openly available professional data. Citizen science participation was primarily driven by ease of access, especially the presence of trails. However, citizen science use of the trail network differed from other types of recreational trail use, including a weaker preference for well-established trails and a stronger association with developed areas. This improved understanding of patterns in citizen science participation may be used to better account for spatial biases in citizen science data and to manage natural areas in a way that supports and guides future citizen science activity.},
