## Abstract
This investigation uses biodiversity data cubes, derived from the datasets mobilised by the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), to conduct an analysis of sex ratios of ducks across Europe. Encompassing over 4 million occurrences extracted from nearly 5000 datasets, this study elucidates sex distribution patterns across various species, focussing on temporal and spatial dynamics. The aim of this study is to highlight the availability of open sex data and its potential usefulness in research and monitoring of sex ratios of wild organisms, particularly in sexual dimorphic species.

## Introduction
The balance of sex ratios in animal populations is a critical indicator of ecological health and evolutionary dynamics [@10.1134/S2079086421030099]. Alterations in these ratios can reflect environmental stresses, reproductive strategies, or human influence. However, a significant challenge in accurately assessing these ratios stems from the differential detectability of males and females in many species. Factors such as behavioural differences, sexual dimorphism, and varying habitat preferences can substantially influence the likelihood of observing and recording individuals of each sex. This variability in detectability complicates the interpretation of raw sex ratio data, potentially skewing our understanding of population dynamics. Biodiversity data cubes, particularly those derived from the heterogeneous data mobilised by GBIF, offers an avenue to explore these biological phenomena. By aggregating vast amounts of occurrence data, these cubes potentially allow for the application of analytical techniques to address the issue of differential detectability. This study leverages such a data cube to examine sex ratio dynamics within the European ducks, swans and geese, aiming to uncover patterns that could inform conservation efforts and ecological understanding, while always considering the implications of detectability differences on our analyses.

## Materials and Methods
### Data
The SQL query run on the 2nd April 2024 is detailed below. It extracted 4,038,527 aggregated rows from GBIF ([@10.15468/dl.aqumsn]). The data are restricted to GBIF family key 2986 that is the code for the Anatidae, the  family that includes ducks, geese, and swans. The records were aggregated to a 10 km<sup>2 grid using the EEA grid system. Aggregated occurrences were also restricted to those after 1900 and to the continent of Europe. Records already identified as invalid were excluded.
The resulting dataset aggregates data from 4,985 published datasets on GBIF, involving 230 publishers.

Through the strategic exclusion of the `dwc:individualCount` from our analysis to simplify the initial approach, we aim to provide a foundational understanding of sex ratio variations and how they could be use to monitor population status and trends of biodiversity.

Our analytical framework is predicated on a selective extraction from the GBIF dataset, focusing on records designated as "PRESENT" while excluding data compromised by spatial inaccuracies. The analysis was facilitated by Pythonâ€™s scientific stack, including pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and seaborn for visualisation, and GeoPandas with Shapely for spatial analysis. This study processes the derived biodiversity data cube, augmenting it with necessary spatial and temporal attributes, and preparing it for analysis.


## Results
The application of geospatial and temporal analytical techniques has unveiled significant insights into the sex ratio distribution across the European continent. Visualisation of male and female counts over decades has revealed discernible patterns and anomalies, indicating both temporal fluctuations and spatial variations. This detailed exploration provides a nuanced understanding of sex ratio dynamics, showcasing the areas and times of notable deviations.

Taking the mallard as an example a timeseries of male to female ratio has been produced.

## Discussion
The findings from this study highlight the intricate relationship between sex ratios and environmental, biological, and anthropogenic factors. The use of biodiversity data cubes derived from GBIF data represents a novel approach to biodiversity studies, allowing for large-scale analysis that was previously unattainable. This research not only contributes valuable insights into sex ratio analysis but also demonstrates the potential of biodiversity data cubes in advancing ecological and conservation science.

## Conclusion
This study underscores the importance of biodiversity data cubes in facilitating large-scale analyses of ecological phenomena. By exploring sex ratio variations within European animal populations, this research contributes to the broader understanding of biodiversity patterns and their underlying mechanisms. The insights derived from this analysis advocate for the continued development and utilisation of biodiversity data cubes, highlighting their significance in ecological research and conservation strategies.
